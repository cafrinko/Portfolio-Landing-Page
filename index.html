          <h3><strong>About Catherine</strong></h3>
            <p>Catherine is an aspiring user experience and interaction designer. She has a wide-ranging educational background in visual art, environmental engineering, and holistic public health. Included in her myriad of professional interests is a love for the intersections of art and technology, she hopes to design educational journeys that engage users through aesthetically stunning interactive art installations. To this end, she recently began attending Epicodus, a socially conscious code school in Portland, Oregon that values and respects the differences among people. When she finishes her program in September of 2016, she will be relocating to Berlin to become immersed in their flourishing art/tech culture.</p>
            <p>Catherine's personal interests involve keeping abreast of social and environmental justice movements, reading fiction and poetic nonfiction, preparing food, nature walks, bicycling, and juggling. Though a jack-of-all-trades, she strives to become a master of all of them.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">Now to deliver the goods!</span> So far. The following are the projects that Catherine has worked on at Epicodus during her first fledgling four days at school. They were labored over with pair programming partners, who she would like to credit for half of the work. You will laugh; you will cry; just ensure to take in the experience of viewing these with a grain of potassium because they are her first websites she ever made.</p>
